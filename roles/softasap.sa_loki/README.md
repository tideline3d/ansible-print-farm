sa_loki
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/softasap/sa_loki.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/softasap/sa_loki)

Example of usage:

Simple

```YAML

     - {
         role: "sa_loki",
         loki_version: "1.5.0"
       }
```

Advanced

```YAML

roles:

     - {
         role: "sa_loki",
         loki_version: "1.5.0",
         loki_user:   loki,
         loki_group:  loki,
         loki_base_dir: /opt/loki
       }
```

Connecting clients
------------------

In difference from prometheus, Loki uses push concept. I.e. promtail clients are pushing payload to loki cluster.
It works like a charm in AWS or similar cloud, when you are using private addresses, but if you do not have private network,
most likely you will need to limit access a bit...

```
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.215 proto tcp to any port 3100
```

Usage with ansible galaxy workflow
----------------------------------

If you installed the `sa_loki` role using the command


`
   ansible-galaxy install softasap.sa_loki
`

the role will be available in the folder `library/softasap.sa_loki`
Please adjust the path accordingly.

```YAML

     - {
         role: "softasap.sa_loki"
       }

```
